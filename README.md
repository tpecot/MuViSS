# MuViSS
ImageJ macro for segmenting Muscle, Visceral and Subcutaneous fat from L3-CT scans.

<br />
A deep learning (U-Net) model was trained to automatically identify the backbone, muscle area, visceral and subcutaneous fat from L3-CT scans. This model was converted to be directly processed with ImageJ. The macro allows to extract the ratio of segmented areas within a predefined intensity range corresponding to the different tissues (muscle, visceral and subcutaneous fat). If the segmentation fails, the user can also give a manual segmentation as an input.<br />
